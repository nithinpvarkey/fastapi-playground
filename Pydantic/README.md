Pydantic is a data validation and parsing library for Python that provides efficient data validation and settings management using Python type annotations. It uses Python's type hints to validate and parse input data, ensuring data consistency, making it particularly useful in scenarios such as web APIs with FastAPI.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Players(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    team: str
```
***Model*** Creation: Players inherits from BaseModel which gives data parsing and validation features.

```python
@app.get("/players/{team_id}")
async def team_player(team_id: int ) -> Players:
    team = next((Players(**t) for t in PLAYERS if t['id']== team_id), None)

    #    # If no player with the specified team ID is found, raise a 404 error
    if team is None:
        raise HTTPException(status_code = 404, detail ="team not found")
        
    return team
```
***Data Parsing***: When Players(**player_data) is used, Pydantic automatically converts and validates player_data to match the Players schema (id as int, name and team as str).

***Automatic Validation***: If you pass incorrect data types, Pydantic raises errors.
